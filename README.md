# dgt

`dgt` is a Docker compose group task manager. *That's a mouthful.* I made `dgt` with the goal of making my small-scale server compose files groupable and easy to maintain.

## Configuration

Create a `dgt.toml` file in the path you plan to run `dgt` in. You can find examples of this file in the `examples` directory.
